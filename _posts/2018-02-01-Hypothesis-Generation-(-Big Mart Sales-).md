## Store Level Hypotheses:

* City type: Stores located in urban or Tier 1 cities should have higher sales because of the higher income levels of people there.
* Population Density: Stores located in densely populated areas should have higher sales because of more demand.
* Store Capacity: Stores which are very big in size should have higher sales as they act like one-stop-shops and people would prefer getting everything from one place
* Location: Stores located within popular marketplaces should have higher sales because of better access to customers.
* Customer Behavior: Stores keeping the right set of products to meet the local needs of customers will have higher sales.

## Product Level Hypotheses:

* Brand: Branded products should have higher sales because of higher trust in the customer.
* Packaging: Products with good packaging can attract customers and sell more.
* Utility: Daily use products should have a higher tendency to sell as compared to the specific use products.
* Display Area: Products which are given bigger shelves in the store are likely to catch attention first and sell more.
* Visibility in Store: The location of product in a store will impact sales. Ones which are right at entrance will catch the eye of customer first rather than the ones in back.
